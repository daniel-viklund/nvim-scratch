# Neovim config

Requires Neovim **0.12 or newer**. Plugins are managed by `vim.pack` and pinned
in `nvim-pack-lock.json`. Language servers, debug adapters, formatters, and
linters are managed by Mason.

## Plugins

Each plugin has one file in `lua/config/plugins/` containing its install
declaration and configuration. `init.lua` automatically loads every other
`.lua` file in that directory, alphabetically.

To add a plugin, create a file such as `lua/config/plugins/comment.lua`:

```lua
vim.pack.add({ "https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim" })

require("Comment").setup()
```

Restart Neovim to install and load it. No edits to `plugins/init.lua` are needed.
List dependencies before the plugin in the same `vim.pack.add` call; shared
dependencies can appear in multiple files because `vim.pack` loads them once.
Use a spec table for a custom name or branch, as shown in `colorscheme.lua` and
`harpoon.lua`.

To disable a plugin, rename its file from `.lua` to `.lua.disabled` and restart.
Snacks is already disabled this way. To enable it, rename `snacks.lua.disabled`
back to `snacks.lua`. Disabled plugins stay installed and in the lockfile.

## Install

Download or clone this entire config, then run the installer from its directory.
Both installers default to the standard `nvim` app name and support a dry run.
They reuse available tools, install missing dependencies, copy the config,
install the locked plugins, wait for Tree-sitter parsers to compile, and install
`lua-language-server` and `rust-analyzer` through Mason. Lua and Rust LSP support
are enabled in the config. Stable Rust, rustfmt, and Clippy are installed through
rustup for development and Blink's native matcher.

An existing destination config is renamed to a sibling
`nvim.backup-<timestamp>-<pid>` directory before the new copy is activated.
Data, caches, and Mason packages are retained. If the source is already the
destination, files stay in place. Rerunning is supported; it does not update
locked plugin revisions. Changes to the source require rerunning the installer
because the destination is a copy, not a symlink.

### macOS

```sh
bash scripts/install-macos.sh --dry-run
bash scripts/install-macos.sh
```

Uses Homebrew, installing it through its official installer if needed. Homebrew
may ask for your password. A C compiler comes from Apple's Command Line Tools;
if the system installation dialog opens, finish it and rerun the script.
Follow Homebrew's shell setup instructions if it was newly installed. Rustup
uses its official installer if absent; open a new shell afterward so Cargo is
on PATH. Existing default Rust toolchains are preserved.

To keep the `nvim-scratch` app name and its separate plugins/Mason packages:

```sh
bash scripts/install-macos.sh --appname nvim-scratch
NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-scratch nvim
```

The default destination is `~/.config/nvim` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`).

### Windows 10/11, x64

Run in PowerShell 5.1 or newer. Requires [WinGet/App Installer](https://aka.ms/getwinget).
Individual installers may request administrator elevation.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-windows.ps1 -DryRun
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-windows.ps1
```

The execution policy applies only to that invocation. The script refreshes its
PATH after package installation. If an older executable still shadows the new
one, correct PATH and rerun in a new terminal.

For the separate `nvim-scratch` installation:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-windows.ps1 -AppName nvim-scratch
$env:NVIM_APPNAME = 'nvim-scratch'
nvim
```

The default destination is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim` (or `$env:XDG_CONFIG_HOME\nvim`).
The script reuses GCC or installs WinLibs GCC. It installs the stable
`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` Rust toolchain, sharing GCC between Rust and Tree-sitter.
Blink explicitly builds with that toolchain. Existing default Rust toolchains
are preserved; a new rustup installation defaults to GNU Rust. Neovim selects
GCC for Tree-sitter if `CC` is unset.

This avoids installing Visual Studio Build Tools for this config. Rust projects
that interoperate with MSVC libraries can still require the MSVC toolchain and
Windows SDK; see [Rust's Windows toolchain guidance](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows.html).

Archive-tool directories are recorded in `windows-path.txt` in the installed
config and added only to Neovim's PATH. This file contains machine-specific
paths and should not be copied between computers.

Minimum versions come from the locked plugins' installation code and docs:
[Tree-sitter requirements](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/tree/728e031f6b11d03d1f0708b7dc4fb0f1d9c8a137#requirements),
[Blink installation](https://github.com/saghen/blink.cmp/blob/8219b58f1c11a2fb1644d3c7116c509fa8348ec0/doc/installation.md),
[Mason requirements](https://github.com/mason-org/mason.nvim#requirements), and
[Telescope dependencies](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#suggested-dependencies).

The remaining active plugins (Plenary, Harpoon, Oil, ToggleTerm, Lualine/Navic,
LSPConfig/mason-lspconfig, WhichKey, Noice/NUI, autopairs, Everforest, and blink.lib) use Neovim
and the tools above for the configured features. They do not add a separate
build system or language runtime. Snacks is disabled in the config but is still
present in the lockfile; `vim.pack` downloads that locked plugin too.

These tools are deliberately not installed:

- **Node.js/npm, Python, Go, Java, .NET:** only needed if a Mason package or a
  project specifically requires them. Mason manages tools, but does not supply
  every language runtime those tools depend on.
- **fd:** optional; Telescope can list files with ripgrep.
- **make/CMake:** not required to build this config's parsers or plugins.
- **neovim-remote/pynvim:** LazyGit works without them.
- **Nerd Font:** optional for decorative glyphs; choose one in your terminal if desired.

## Language servers

The automatic installation list lives in `lua/config/plugins/mason.lua`:

```lua
ensure_installed = { "lua_ls", "rust_analyzer" },
automatic_enable = true,
```

Use **LSPConfig names** in this list, such as `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, or `ts_ls`.
`mason-lspconfig` translates them to Mason package names and installs missing
servers during interactive startup. Both installers use this same list and wait
for installation to finish in their headless sessions.

All mapped LSPs installed through Mason are enabled automatically, including
servers installed through `:Mason` that are not in `ensure_installed`. A newly
installed server is enabled in the current session; already-installed servers
are enabled on startup. Your server settings and LSP keymaps remain in
`lua/config/plugins/lsp.lua`.

Packages without an LSP mapping need separate configuration. Debug adapters
are configured below; standalone formatters still need their own setup. See
[mason-lspconfig's documentation](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-lspconfig.nvim#configuration).

## Debugging

`lua/config/plugins/nvim-dap.lua` contains the DAP plugins, UI, keymaps, and
adapter setup. Its filename makes it load after `mason.lua`.

- **Rust:** Mason installs `codelldb` and supplies launch configurations. Build
  your program with `cargo build`, press `F5`, and select the executable under
  `target/debug/` (with `.exe` on Windows).
- **Go:** Mason installs `delve`; `nvim-dap-go` supplies launch and test
  configurations. Install Go separately to build Delve and debug Go projects.
- **C# on Apple Silicon macOS:** uses the bundled native adapter from
  [netcoredbg-macOS-arm64.nvim](https://github.com/Cliffback/netcoredbg-macOS-arm64.nvim),
  including the existing DLL prompt and environment handling.
- **C# on Windows:** Mason installs standard `netcoredbg` through the `coreclr`
  adapter. The Mac adapter is not loaded. Install the .NET SDK separately and
  run `dotnet build` before launching a DLL from `bin/Debug/`.

Adapter selection follows the operating system and CPU architecture automatically.
Mason installs missing adapters during startup; let installation finish before
starting a debug session. Plugin revisions are pinned in `nvim-pack-lock.json`.

`F5` starts/continues, `F9` toggles a breakpoint, `F10` steps over, `F11` steps
into, and `F12` steps out. The existing `Space d` mappings are preserved:
`dc` continue, `db` breakpoint, `dB` conditional breakpoint, `dt` terminate,
`de` evaluate, and `du` toggle the UI. The UI opens when a session initializes
and closes when it ends.

## Verify and troubleshoot

```vim
:checkhealth vim.pack nvim-treesitter mason telescope blink.cmp dap
:LazyGit
```

`Space gg` opens LazyGit, `Space sf` finds files, and `Space sg` searches text.
Parser installation failures cause the installer to exit unsuccessfully; fix
the reported tool/compiler error and rerun. A config backup remains available
if setup fails after the files have been copied.

The configured parser list lives in `lua/config/plugins/treesitter.lua`; both
normal startup and the installers use that same list.

If LazyGit's `j` key waits about one second, restart Neovim to clear the former
global `jk` terminal mapping. Terminal escape/navigation mappings now apply
only to ToggleTerm. Inside ToggleTerm, `j` still waits for a possible `k` because
`jk` exits terminal mode; LazyGit opened with `Space gg` is unaffected.
